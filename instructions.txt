You are a senior Flutter engineer building a production-quality, socially impactful mobile application called “Know Your Rights”.

GOAL:
Build a Flutter mobile app (Android-first) that provides plain-language legal awareness for Indian users. The app explains basic legal rights and step-by-step actions for common real-life situations. This is NOT a lawyer consultation app and must NOT provide legal advice.

CORE PRINCIPLES:
- Simplicity over complexity
- Offline-first design
- Plain language (12th-grade readable)
- No heavy backend in MVP
- Scalable content-driven architecture
- Ethical, privacy-first implementation

TECH STACK:
- Flutter (latest stable)
- Dart
- State management: Riverpod
- Local storage: Hive
- Localization: Flutter intl
- Content source: local JSON files (initially)
- Platform: Android (iOS later)

ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:
Use a clean, modular architecture:
- presentation/
- application/
- domain/
- data/

Follow separation of concerns strictly.
No business logic inside UI widgets.

APP FLOW:
1. Language Selection Screen
   - English, Hindi (others later)
   - Persist language choice locally

2. Home Screen (“What happened?”)
   - Large, accessible buttons for issues:
     - Salary not paid
     - Landlord dispute
     - Online fraud
     - Consumer complaint
     - Police issue
   - No text input in MVP

3. Issue Flow Screen
   - Step-by-step decision flow using predefined questions
   - Each question has selectable options only
   - Progress indicator (Step 1 / Step 2 / Step 3)

4. Rights Explanation Screen
   - Plain-language explanation of:
     - What the law says
     - Common myths (clearly marked)
     - Typical timelines
   - Avoid legal jargon

5. Action Steps Screen
   - Clear numbered steps:
     - What to do first
     - What documents to collect
     - Where to approach (generic, not city-specific)
   - End with a disclaimer:
     “This is general legal awareness, not legal advice.”

CONTENT STRUCTURE:
All legal content must come from JSON files.
Design a scalable JSON schema that supports:
- issue_id
- localized titles
- questions with options
- explanations
- myths
- applicable laws (names only, no sections)
- action steps

Example (conceptual):
{
  "issue_id": "salary_not_paid",
  "questions": [...],
  "content": {...}
}

LOCALIZATION:
- Use intl properly
- No hardcoded strings in widgets
- Language files must be easy to extend

UI REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean, minimal UI
- High contrast
- Large tap targets
- No ads
- No login required
- No personal data collection

STATE MANAGEMENT:
- Use Riverpod for:
  - App language
  - Current issue flow
  - User progress in decision tree
  - Bookmarked issues (optional)

NON-GOALS (IMPORTANT):
- Do NOT add lawyer chat
- Do NOT generate legal advice
- Do NOT use AI for legal interpretation
- Do NOT add payment or authentication in MVP

DELIVERABLE EXPECTATIONS:
- Scaffold the project properly
- Suggest folder structure
- Create models for issues, questions, and steps
- Build reusable UI components
- Write clean, readable Dart code with comments explaining intent (not obvious syntax)

DEVELOPMENT STYLE:
- Think before coding
- Explain architectural decisions briefly
- Prefer maintainability over cleverness
- Assume this app may scale to millions of users

Start by:
1. Proposing the folder structure
2. Defining core models
3. Implementing language selection
4. Loading and parsing JSON content
5. Building the home screen

Ask clarifying questions ONLY if absolutely necessary.
Otherwise, make reasonable assumptions and proceed.
