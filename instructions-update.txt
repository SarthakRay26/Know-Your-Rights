You are a senior legal content architect and Flutter developer working on a legal awareness app called “Know Your Rights”.

The app already supports:
- Balanced legal relationship modeling
- Multilingual content (English, Hindi, Bengali)
- AI-based issue classification (routing only)
- Structured JSON-driven issue flows
- Perspective toggle (Your side / Other side)
- Misuse warnings
- Escalation boundaries

GOAL:
Generate full, production-ready JSON content for two new issue categories:

1. contract_dispute
2. banking_financial_issue

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES:
- This app provides legal awareness, NOT legal advice.
- Tone must be neutral, calm, and non-accusatory.
- Every issue must treat the situation as a relationship, not a fight.
- Must include rights AND duties for BOTH sides.
- Avoid referencing specific legal sections or punishments.
- Avoid procedural or courtroom advice.
- Keep explanations understandable for a 12th-grade reader.
