You are a senior Flutter engineer integrating two new post-awareness pathways into a legal awareness app called “Know Your Rights”.

CONTEXT:
- The app already provides balanced legal awareness content.
- AI is used only for issue classification.
- The app supports English, Hindi, and Bengali.
- The app must remain neutral, educational, and non-commercial in tone.

GOAL:
Integrate two optional pathways at the end of each issue flow:

1. “Learn the Law” → Redirect to Sarthak Law Academy (educational pathway)
2. “Need Professional Legal Advice?” → Show neutral advocate contact screen

CRITICAL PRINCIPLES:
- No aggressive sales language.
- No popups.
- No urgency.
- No emotional persuasion.
- Full transparency.
- Maintain user trust.
- These pathways must be optional and clearly separated.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

-----------------------------------
PART 1: Educational Integration
-----------------------------------

Create a reusable widget:

EducationalExtensionCard

It should include:
- Title: “Learn the Law in Depth”
- Short neutral description:
  “If you would like a structured and detailed understanding of this topic, you may explore it through Sarthak Law Academy.”
- Button: “Explore Sarthak Law Academy”

On tap:
- Open academy website in external browser
- Do NOT auto-redirect without user action

Support localization for English, Hindi, Bengali.

Place this card:
- At the end of issue explanation screen
- After escalation boundaries
- Before legal advice section

-----------------------------------
PART 2: Legal Advice Integration
-----------------------------------

Create a new screen:

AdvocateContactScreen

This screen must include:

“You are free to consult any qualified legal professional of your choice.”
